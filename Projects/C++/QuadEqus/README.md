### Example
To solve `6x^2 - 17x + 12 = 0` with QuadEqus:

1. Find coefficients:  
    `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` => `a = 6; b = -17; c = 12;`

2. Write them separated by commas or spaces to the program

```
> 6 -17 12

D: 1
x1: 1.500000
x2: 1.333333
```

3. That's it. You can now exit the program with `exit` command
